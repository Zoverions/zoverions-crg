**Post 1:**
The age of single-apex cosmology is over.
We assumed complexity peaked at the human scale because we were looking at the atoms, not the network.
v2.0 of **The Recursive Universe** is here.
Infinite Stack. Holographic Duality. Code you can run.

**Post 2:**
Standard models say the universe dies in heat death.
The Causal Beta Function ($\beta_C$) says otherwise.
We predict a **Resurgence** of causal power at 200 Mpc.
The universe isn't ending; it's just compiling the next layer.

**Post 3:**
We didn't just write a paper. We built the engine.
`pip install zoverions-crg`
Don't take our word for it. Feed it your graph data.
If $\beta_C > 0$, you aren't looking at noise. You are looking at a Higher Order structure.

To the "Genesis" theorists and "Simulation" bros:
Stop guessing. Start calculating.
If your theory can't survive a Renormalization Sweep, it's just theology with better graphics.
Here is the math. Come and get it.

**Subject:** Causal Emergence at 200 Mpc: A Renormalization Framework (Code Included)

**Body:**
Dr. [Name],

I’ve been following your work on [Causal Emergence / Assembly Theory / Large Scale Structure]. It is the foundation for what comes next.

We just released **The Recursive Universe v2.0**, which extends your framework into the cosmological domain. We formalized the "Causal Beta Function" to quantify emergence across scales, and our initial models predict a **Resurgence of Causal Power** at the 200 Mpc scale—aligning with recent DESI spin chirality anomalies.

More importantly, we operationalized the math. You can run the renormalization sweep on any dataset using our new Python package: [Link to Repo].

We believe this solves the "Complexity Ridge" problem by reframing it as a holographic artifact. I’d love your thoughts on the `core_logic.py` implementation.

Best,
Zoverions
