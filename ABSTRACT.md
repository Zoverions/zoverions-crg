**Title:** The Recursive Universe v2.0: Causal Renormalization, Infinite Stack, and Holographic Duality
**Abstract:**
We present the Causal Renormalization Group (CRG) as a universal framework for quantifying the flow of Effective Information across cosmological scales. By treating causal power as a scale-dependent running coupling, we derive the Causal Beta Function, $\beta_C(\lambda)$, which categorizes systems into regimes of Reductionist Decay ($\beta_C < 0$) or Causal Emergence ($\beta_C > 0$). Contrary to standard models which posit a "Complexity Ridge" terminating at biological scales, we demonstrate that the Cosmic Web exhibits a **Resurgence** of causal efficacy at $\lambda \approx 200$ Mpc. This is formalized in the **Recursive Attractor Theorem**, which proves that under Generative Continuity and Holographic bounds, the renormalization flow admits an infinite discrete spectrum of positive fixed points. We operationalize this framework via the open-source `zoverions-crg` package and provide falsifiable predictions for DESI spin chirality correlations and void negentropy.
